- Setup docker and docker-compose
- Install hyperpixel4 display
- Add these lines to your `~/.bashrc`
```bash
# Run PADD
# If weâ€™re on the PiTFT screen (ssh is xterm)
if [ "$TERM" == "linux" ] ; then
  while :
  do
    docker exec -it pihole bash /padd/padd.sh
    sleep 1
  done
fi
```
- Pull this repo
- Edit values in `docker-compose.yml`
- Start the stack with `docker-compose up -d`

## Test DNS performance
